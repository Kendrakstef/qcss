# qcss

Qualified CSS
-------------

A simple group of minimalized css to use as an easy out-of-the-box css framework without hassling with LESS,LASS and whatsoever by using the good old html creative class group naming approach.

It includes
-----------

 + color classes concept
 + spacing classes concept
 + ratio classes concept
 + typo classes concept
 + hover classes concept

Slogan
------

Back to basics. Make your work independend from toys. Use the html class attribute what it is made for. And use it much, and right.

Why
---

QCSS keeps the project independed from any compiler or other concepts than html/css and can do the so called "sliding" changes often asked for by companies, what other layered dev-stack concepts suffer from. Without revamping the whole LESS/SASS stack or other concepts which need many additional concept overthinking while editing. These modern doubtless helpful additonal layers all have the one big disadvantage that their suffer from the ability to keep up consistency and colligation when making direct minimalist changes in a little corner of a project or when "unchaining" of style groups is needed. QCSS uses a smart class group concept, easy to remember after some working with it, and simply to define. And you always know what comes from where.

I partly uses the KISS and CoC principle in the way that you only alter the overall look in the grouped css, while you alter the affecting parts the good old way: by only changing the regarding classes in html. *"What do you mean with the other red, there is only one red, the red defined in CSS"...*

Roadmap
-------

We want to see where it goes and if it expands well after further development and maybe some contribution of other ideas. We agree about that if it does not work out well, we accept the missed challenge. But until then we will try our best.

Reasons
-------

Inspired by the low level enthusiasts, the prior goal was to keep the creating, editing and after all the altering of the look of an html output as minimlistic and independend from any other "tools" as possible (chime in, change a nitpick and go) without losing too much of the advantages of all these fancy "tools" out there, triggered by the experience that many of the new fancy web development stuff becomes old very soon or changes their concept very often and keeps web dev teams always hussling with them rendering their advantages obsolete again.
