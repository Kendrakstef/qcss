Qualified CSS
-------------

A simple group of minimalized css to use as an easy out-of-the-box css framework without hassling with LESS,LASS and whatsoever by unsing the good old html class approach. It makes you independed from any compiler and can do the so called "sliding" changes often asked for by companies without rewamping the whole LESS/SASS stack. It uses a smart class group concept good to remember and simply to define and you always know what comes from where.

It includes
-----------

 + color classes concept
 + spacing classes concept
 + ratio classes concept
 + typo classes concept
 + hover classes concept

Slogan
------

Back to basics. Make your work independend from toys. Use the html class attribute what it is made for. And use it much, and right.

Roadmap
-------

We want to see where it goes and if it expands well after further development and maybe some contribution of other ideas. We agree about that if it does not work out well, we accept the missed challenge. But until then we will try our best.

Reasons
-------

Inspired by the low level enthusiasts, the prior goal was to keep the creating, editing and after all the altering of the look of an html output as minimlistic and independend from any other "tools" as possible (chime in, change a nitpick and go) without losing too much of the advantages of all these fancy "tools" out there, triggered by the experience that many of the new fancy web development stuff becomes old very soon or changes their concept very often and keeps web dev teams always hussling with them rendering their advantages obsolete again.
